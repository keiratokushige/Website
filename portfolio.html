         <h2>We used the Rover Data to create four individual graphs to represent the four sensors of sound light, temperature, and a gyroscope. Based on our graphs we think the Rover came from the Inland Forests because the patterns of our graphs matched the conditions that were represented by the forest. The Inland Forest has smooth constant temperatures that vary slightly throughout the day, low ambient light during daytime, constant howl of the wind (occasional thunderstorms), and little to no wind. After filtering the data and making the ranges of the graphs even we believe these qualities of the Inland Forest match the Rover data.</h2>
